      <description>I am a third year undergraduate student in Department of Automation, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, expecting to graduate in June 2019.
My research interests include video analysis, robotic vision and general problems in computer vision. My current work focuses on dense detailed multi-label action detection tasks in untrimmed videos.</description>

      <description>HIKVISION RESEARCH INSTITUTE Research Intern, Intelligent Algorithm Department  July. 2018 - Present
Over the last few years, while excellent results have been achieved in the field of static image understanding, there is still a long way to go for video understanding. I’m interested in this challenging topic and particularly interested in human activity detection tasks. I have done some related research work, listed as follows:
 Examined large-scale video datasets which depict a variety of complex human activities in untrimmed videos, including Charades, THUMOS and MultiTHUMOS.</description>

      <description>Obstacle Detection for Vision Based Navigation Autonomous Robot Lab, SJTU
Detecting the obstacles accurately and reliably is important for navigating the robot or autonomous vehicle. The latest sensor technologies and computer vision plays a key role in making this pragmatically realizable. Deep Neural Networks like Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) are widely used for object detection and segmentation algorithms.
 Used the SegNet encoder-decoder architecture for pixel-wise semantic segmentation of the video frame.</description>
