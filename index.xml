      <description>I am a third year undergraduate student in Department of Automation, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, expecting to graduate in June 2019.
My research interests include video analysis, robotic vision and general problems in computer vision. My current work focuses on dense detailed multi-label action detection tasks in untrimmed videos.</description>

      <description>HIKVISION RESEARCH INSTITUTE Research Intern, Intelligent Algorithm Department
Iâ€™ve recently been researching on visual analysis of human activity and have done some related work, listed as follows:
 Examined large-scale video benchmark datasets which depict a variety of complex human activities in untrimmed videos, including Charades, THUMOS and MultiTHUMOS.
 Learned the basic ideas of existing approaches on MultiTHUMOS, including MultiLSTM, predictive-corrective networks, biLSTM, siLSTM and super-event presentation. Briefly compared their strengths and weaknesses.</description>

      <description>Obstacle Detection for Vision Based Navigation for Autonomous Driving Autonomous Robot Lab, SJTU
  Detecting the obstacles accurately and reliably is important for navigating the robot or autonomous vehicle. The cost effective monocular camera sensor along with computer vision techniques plays a key role in making this pragmatically realizable. Deep Neural Networks like Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) are widely used for object detection and segmentation algorithms.
 Used the SegNet encoder-decoder architecture for pixel-wise semantic segmentation of the video frame.</description>
